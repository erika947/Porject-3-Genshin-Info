# Genshin Impact Api Backend
What I wanted to do with my backend it be able to create two database schemas that will allow for the user to browse the website for different info base on the character or weapon they selected.

## Base URL link:
This is the link that will lead you to my Website that is used in these pages:
* https://genshin-character-info-app.herokuapp.com/ 

## Navgation Bar
---
I decided that I wanted to have a easier way for the user to go back and forth from the show page and main page.

In the Navagation Bar there are only two option at the moment which is the Homepage and the Weapons page. I plan to on day add more option such as Artifacts, Talents, etc.

## HomePage 
---
On the Homepage there are a total of 20 characters that the user can choose from. Once the user has who they want to select they can just click on the image and it will redirect the page to the character Info page.

## Weapons Page
---
The weapons page is very much similar to the homepage where there is 20 different weapons to select from. Also once clicked on it will redirect to there own page aswell.

# Inspiration
---
I have recently been playing Genshin Impact and really love the characters. So I wanted to create something that had to do with them.

The background that was used for the website was taken by a player who played the game. Really loved the colors that it had and tried to use colors that were around the same shade of blue.

## Other functions
---
There are two other options that are available when you click on a character. 

Once you are on there info page if you scroll down you will see that there is a Edit and delete button that with allow you to remove a certain character or edit there profile.

## Images
---
* Credits of images and info go to [Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki)
* Credits of Images and Info go to [The Offical Genshin Impact webPage](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/mondstadt?char=0)
* Wallpaper by [Geulach](https://whvn.cc/x81glo)

## Styling
---
* Bootstrap was used to edit my edit and delete button
* CSS Grid
* Color picker (which help to get the colors from my back ground)


## Ideas that I want to work on
---
I would love to add more pages and to also add them to my Navagation Bar.

To edit my mouse cursor so it will have the same theme as the website.

To add music to the Homepage.

To add images from the game 

Work on getting the Create page up and running so other characters can be added.
